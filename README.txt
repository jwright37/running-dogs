I made the running dogs gifs by creating a background image that repeated both horizontally and vertically.
I did this in the css file rather that the html file because a background is a stylistic element, not some content that
should be in the body. 

I put the link in the bottom right corner by using the fixed position rule, then setting the bottom and right rules to 0.

To make the music play, I used the <audio> tag with the autoplay and loop characteristics. This way, the viewer does not 
have to control the music playback and the music will loop forever. 

I spent about an hour on this project.

The only help I got was from Tony, who showed my how to make a ssh key.
